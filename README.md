## Welcome to my website!

I am in the pioneer cohort of METIS Data Scientist Bootcamp from 8th July to 27th September 2019. We will be completing one group project and four individual projects in this 12-week bootcamp.

As of now, we are in project 4 and our deadline is 6th September 2019!

I will be sharing my completed projects here.

Feel free to contact me if you need any assitance. Cheers
